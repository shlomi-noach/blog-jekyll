<p>"Walking a string" is an SQL technique to convert a single value into multiple rows result set. For example, walking the string <strong>'hello'</strong> results with 5 rows, each of which contains a single character from the text.</p>
<p>I'll present a brief example of walking a string, and then show how to "unwalk" the string: do the reverse operation.</p>
<p>To walk a string, an integers table is required (or this could be a good use for <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/detail/6891">SeqEngine</a>):<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>CREATE TABLE `int_table` (
  `int_col` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`int_col`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1

-- ...
-- INSERTS follow here
-- ...

mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM int_table;
+---------+
| int_col |
+---------+
|       0 |
|       1 |
|       2 |
|       3 |
|       4 |
|       5 |
|       6 |
|       7 |
|       8 |
|       9 |
+---------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To convert a string to rows of characters, we join the text with the integers table (we assume there are enough numbers for covering the length of the text):</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT
         SUBSTRING(s, int_col+1, 1) AS c
       FROM int_table, (SELECT 'hello' AS s) sel1
       WHERE int_col &lt; char_length(s);
+---+
| c |
+---+
| h |
| e |
| l |
| l |
| o |
+---+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Unwalking the string</h4>
<p>Doing the inverse action - combining the string back from the multiple rows, can be easily done using <strong>GROUP_CONCAT</strong>. It's interesting to learn that<strong> GROUP_CONCAT</strong> does not actually require any <strong>GROUP BY</strong> clause. When no such clause is provided in the SQL query, all searched rows are used.</p>
<p>Let's assume now that we have a table of character values, which we want to concatenate back to a complete string. We can easily build this table:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>CREATE TABLE characters AS
  SELECT
    SUBSTRING(s, int_col+1, 1) AS c
  FROM int_table, (SELECT 'hello' AS s) sel1
  WHERE int_col &lt; char_length(s);</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To reconstruct the text, we simply use MySQL's <strong>GROUP_CONCAT</strong> with an empty separator:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(c separator '') AS s FROM characters;
+-------+
| s     |
+-------+
| hello |
+-------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
</blockquote>
