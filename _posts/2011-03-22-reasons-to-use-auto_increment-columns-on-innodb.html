<p>An InnoDB table must have a primary key (one is created if you don't do it yourself). You may have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key">natural key</a> at hand. Stop! Allow me to suggest an AUTO_INCREMENT may be better.</p>
<p>Why should one add an AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY on a table on which there's a natural key? Isn't an AUTO_INCREMENT a pseudo key, meaning, it doesn't have any explicit relation to the row data, other than it is a number and unique?</p>
<p>Yes, indeed so. Nevertheless, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural keys are many times multi-columned.</li>
<li>Multi column PRIMARY KEYs make for larger keys, and make for bloated secondary keys as well. You may be wasting space for storing the additional AUTO_INCREMENT column, but you may gain space back on secondary keys.</li>
<li>Multi column PRIMARY KEYs make for more locks. See also <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/reducing-locks-by-narrowing-primary-key">this post</a>.</li>
<li>InnoDB INSERTs work considerably faster when worked in ascending PRIMARY KEY order. Can you ensure your natural key is in such order?</li>
<li>Even though an AUTO_INCREMENT makes for an INSERT bottleneck (values must be given serially), it is in particular helpful to InnoDB by ensuring PRIMARY KEY values are in ascending order.</li>
<li>AUTO_INCEMENT makes for chronological resolution. You <em>know</em> what came first, and what came next.</li>
<li>In many datasets, more recent entries are often being accessed more, and are therefore "hotter". By using AUTO_INCREMENT, you're ensuring that recent entries are grouped together within the B+ Tree. This means less random I/O when looking for recent data.</li>
<li>A numerical key is in particular helpful in splitting your table (and tasks on your table) into smaller chunks. I write <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openarkkit/">tools</a> which can work out with any PRIMARY KEY combination, but it's easier to work with numbers.</li>
</ul>
