<p>I'm starting my new position as Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.outbrain.com/">Outbrain</a>. While I'm still to fully grasp the scope of my work, I will be handling data on all things MySQL, Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka, more, more and more, at very large volumes.</p>
<p>I find Outbrain a great supporter of community and open source:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source solutions are highly preferred over commercial solutions</li>
<li>Outbrain is an early adopter for many open source technologies</li>
<li>Employees are encouraged to contribute back as much as possible to the open source community</li>
<li>It is happy to pay for support from companies developing open source</li>
<li>Outbrain is a major participant in the <a href="http://www.iltechtalks.org.il/">ILTechTalks</a> initiative: free, volunteer, professional exchange of knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>I can already testify I will be working with very smart and knowledgeable people; I expect to learn a lot and of course contribute from my own knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>I've been in process with some other companies, I'd like to kindly thank those companies I've been in touch with for their good will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
