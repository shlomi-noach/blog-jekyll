<p>Am now back from <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/">Percona Live</a>, London. Here are some quick impressions of mine.</p>
<p>The physical location of the conference was excellent, not far from Tower Bridge. The conference area itself was nice and has good atmosphere. Very well organized. Kudos to <em>Percona</em>!</p>
<h4>Theme</h4>
<p>The official theme for the conference was <em>"Discover the Power of MySQL"</em>. However, looking back at the conference, I think the de-facto theme was <em>"High Availability and Scale Out for MySQL"</em>.</p>
<p>Why do I say that? Look at the sponsors of the event; look at the talks. There were talks by and about Clustrix, Tungsten (parallel replication), Schooner, Choosing a HA solution (by Henrik), Fusion-IO, MySQL Cluster, MySQL in the Cloud, Galera Replication, Scalebase, Spider, MHA, Various HA Solutions (by Oli Sennhauser)...</p>
<p>There were other talks, about all sorts of things. But to me it seemed like scale-out was the big thing, and HA the next one. Especially looking at sponsors booths it looked that way.</p>
<h4>People</h4>
<p>Of course, it's no secret that meeting the people is a great fun. I met with familiar faces, and was happy to meet new ones. It's great to just discuss stuff with people, share opinions.</p>
<p>The after party was fun, and well organized. Kudos to <em>Clustrix</em> who sponsored it!</p>
<h4>Business talk</h4>
<p>I wasn't at the conference to sell anything myself, and so was on a relaxed mood. I was happy that whatever sales talk I shared, heard or overheard was highly technical and very open. It was also good to openly discuss possible relationships.</p>
<p>I was in particular pleased to see the popularity some of my tools and ideas were gaining. I could recognize at least two talks where my tools were mentioned; I was delighted to talk to DBAs telling me they were using <em>openark-kit</em> in general, <a href="http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/oak-online-alter-table.html">oak-online-alter-table</a> in particular, or some SQL solutions and tricks I offered in my blog. This is really wonderful! To write something having people use it to their benefit -- I suppose this is what open source aspires to. It's great to hear feedback, and better yet to get good feedback.</p>
<p>I also had the pleasure of meeting people after hours, and have good discussions, not necessarily MySQL related.</p>
<p>To top it all, I had free time on Wednesday, where I had a superior visit to the Natural History Museum, which left me in awe.</p>
