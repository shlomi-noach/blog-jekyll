<h4>#DBHangOps</h4>
<p>I had the pleasure of joining into <a href="https://twitter.com/DBHangops">@DBHangOps</a> today, and speak about <a href="https://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/openarkkit/">openark-kit</a>. What was meant to be a 15 minute session turned to be 50 -- sorry, people, I don't talk as much at home, but when it comes to my pet projects...</p>
<p>I also realized I was missing on a great event: DBHangOps is a hangout where you can chat and discuss MySQL &amp; related technologies with friends and colleagues, with whom you typically only meet at conferences. I will certainly want to attend future events.</p>
<p>Thanks to John Cesario and Geoffrey Anderson who invited me to talk, and to the friends and familiar faces who attended; I was happy to talk about my work, and very interested in hearing about how it's being put to use. We also had time to discuss <a href="http://www.markleith.co.uk/ps_helper/">ps_helper</a> with no other than Mark Leith!</p>
<p>The video is <a href="https://twitter.com/DBHangops/status/349965939690835970">available on Twitter/YouTube</a>.</p>
<h4>OurSQL</h4>
<p><em>openark-kit</em> has also been <a href="http://technocation.org/content/oursql-episode-143%3A-biblical-tools">featured on the OurSQL podcast</a> by Sheeri &amp; Gerry, who did great coverage of some tools. I will disclose that more is to come; I'm happy this is in capable hands and look further to hear the next episode!</p>
