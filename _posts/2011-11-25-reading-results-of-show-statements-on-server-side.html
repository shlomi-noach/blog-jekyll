<p><strong>SHOW</strong> statements are show stoppers on server side. While clients can get a <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/show.html">SHOW statement</a> as a result set just as any normal <strong>SELECT</strong>, things are not as such on server side.</p>
<p>On server side, that is, from within MySQL itself, one <em>cannot</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT `Database` FROM (SHOW DATABASES);</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>One <em>cannot</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>DECLARE show_cursor CURSOR FOR SHOW TABLES;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>One <em>cannot</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SHOW TABLES INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/my_file.txt';</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is impossible to get the results with a query; impossible to get the results from a stored routine; impossible to get the results by file reading...</p>
<h4>Bwahaha! A hack!</h4>
<p>For some <strong>SHOW</strong> statements, there is a way around this. I've been banging my head against the wall for weeks now on this. Now I have a partial solution: I'm able to read <strong>SHOW</strong> output for several <strong>SHOW</strong> statements. Namely, those <strong>SHOW</strong> statements <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/extended-show.html">which allow a LIKE or a WHERE</a> clause.</p>
<p>For example, most are familiar with the following syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>USE mysql;
SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 'user';</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>However not so many know that any <strong>SHOW</strong> statement which accepts <strong>LIKE</strong>, can also accept <strong>WHERE</strong>:<!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SHOW TABLE STATUS WHERE Name='user'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           Name: user
         Engine: MyISAM
        Version: 10
     Row_format: Dynamic
           Rows: 17
 Avg_row_length: 69
    Data_length: 1184
Max_data_length: 281474976710655
   Index_length: 2048
      Data_free: 0
 Auto_increment: NULL

</blockquote>
<p>It's not just about "<strong>Name</strong>". I can filter using any column I like:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SHOW TABLE STATUS WHERE Rows &gt; 1000;
SHOW TABLE STATUS WHERE Rows &gt; 1000 AND Index_length &gt; 65536;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>If you've been to my talk on <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/session/programmatic-queries-things-you-can-code-with-sql/">Programmatic Queries: things you can code with SQL</a>, you have a good guess as for where I'm taking this.</p>
<h4>Where there's WHERE, there's code</h4>
<p>I can write code within the <strong>WHERE</strong> clause. Specifically, I can work with user defined variables. Shall we cut to the point and provide with an example?</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; SET @databases := '';

mysql&gt; SHOW DATABASES WHERE (@databases := CONCAT(@databases, `Database`, ',')) IS NULL;

mysql&gt; SELECT @databases;
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| @databases                                                        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| information_schema,common_schema,mycheckpoint,mysql,sakila,world, |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's discuss the above. We:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a user variables called <strong>@databases</strong> to an empty text</li>
<li>Iterate through the <strong>SHOW DATABASES</strong> rowset. The <strong>WHERE</strong> clause is always <em>false</em> (the expression is in fact <strong>NOT NULL</strong> for all rows), so rows are not printed out, and we get an empty result set (we're not really interested in a result set here, since there's no way to read it anyhow).</li>
<li>However we do take care to "remember" the value we visit, by concatenating the <strong>`Database`</strong> column value.</li>
<li>We end up with a delimited string of database names. You'll forgive the ending <strong>','</strong>. This is just a simple example, it is of no importance.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Further notes</h4>
<p>What can we do with the concatenated list of database names? Whatever we want to. We can parse it again, <strong>INSERT</strong> it <strong>INTO</strong> some table, save to file, iterate, what have you!</p>
<p>We can wrap the above in a stored routine. Alas, not with a stored function, since the <strong>SHOW</strong> command, although returns with an empty result set, does return with a result set, not allowed withing functions.<strong></strong></p>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sadly, <strong>SHOW SLAVE STATUS</strong>, <strong>SHOW MASTER LOGS</strong> etc., do not support <strong>LIKE</strong> or <strong>WHERE</strong> syntax. Bummer.</li>
<li>Stored functions, as just mentioned, cannot utilize this hack. Hey, I'm still working on this!</li>
</ul>
<h4>To what use?</h4>
<p>Originally I wanted to avoid the time &amp; locking it takes for <strong>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</strong> queries, such as on <strong>TABLES</strong>, <strong>COLUMNS</strong>, etc. Ironically, in a few days apart I've found <em>another</em> interesting solution (well, two, actually) to manage reads from <strong>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</strong> with less overhead than in normal use. I'll talk about that another time; am about to use this in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/" rel="nofollow">common_schema</a>.</p>
<h4>Further notes</h4>
<p>I met <a href="http://rpbouman.blogspot.com/">Roland</a> in <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/">London</a>, and he liked the solution. As <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/author/baron/">Baron</a> joined, Roland said: "Baron, do you know Shlomi devised a method to read the output of <strong>SHOW</strong> commands?"</p>
<p>And Baron said: "Without using files? Then a <strong>SHOW</strong> statement can have a <strong>WHERE</strong> clause, in which case you can use a variable", and went on looking for his wife.</p>
<p>And we remained speechless.</p>
