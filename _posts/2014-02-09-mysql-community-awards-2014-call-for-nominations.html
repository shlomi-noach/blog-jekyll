<p>The <strong>2014</strong> MySQL Community Awards event will take place, as usual, in Santa Clara, April 2014, during the Percona Live MySQL Conference &amp; Expo (currently scheduled at <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2014/program/schedule/sessions-day-2">Thursday, April 3rd 2014</a>).</p>
<p>The MySQL Community Awards is a community based initiative. The idea is to publicly recognize contributors to the MySQL ecosystem. The entire process of discussing, voting and awarding is controlled by an independent group of community members, typically based of past winners or their representatives, as well as known contributors.</p>
<p>It is a self-appointed, self-declared, self-making-up-the-rules-as-it-goes committee. It is also very aware of the importance of the community; a no-nonsense, non-political, adhering to tradition, self criticizing committee.</p>
<p>The Call for Nominations is open. We are seeking the community’s assistance in nominating candidates in the following categories:</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Community Contributor of the year 2014</h4>
<p>This is a personal award; a winner would a person who has made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This could be via development, advocating, blogging, speaking, supporting, etc. All things go.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Application of the year 2014</h4>
<p>An application, project, product etc. which supports the MySQL ecosystem by either contributing code, complementing its behaviour, supporting its use, etc. This could range from a one man open source project to a large scale social service.</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Corporate Contributor of the year 2013</h4>
<p>A company who made contribution to the MySQL ecosystem. This might be a corporate which released major open source code; one that advocates for MySQL; one that help out community members by... anything.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>As you can see the criteria are flexible. They all boil down to one thing: what gain the nominees provide the community with.</p>
<p>Please also see the <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2013/january/call-nominations-mysql-community-awards-2013">2013 Call for Nominations</a> by Henrik Ingo for more insights; also note the <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2012/february/mysql-hall-fame">MySQL Hall of Fame</a> (up to 2012) and <a href="http://openlife.cc/blogs/2013/april/mysql-community-awards-2013-and-winners-are">2013 winners</a>.</p>
<h4>Process of nomination and voting</h4>
<p>Anyone can nominate anyone. When nominating, please make sure to provide a brief explanation on why the candidate is eligible to get the award. Make a good case!</p>
<p>The committee will review all nominations and vote; it typically takes two rounds of votes to pick the winners, and a lot of discussion.</p>
<p>There will be <em>up to</em> three winners in each category.</p>

<h4>The committee</h4>
<p>Mark Callaghan and myself (Shlomi Noach) are acting as co-secretaries; we will be non-voting (except for breaking ties). Members are: Baron Schwartz, Domas Mituzas, Gerry Narvaja, Giuseppe Maxia, Jeremy Cole, Justin Swanhart, Marc Delisle, Mark Leith, Ronald Bradford, Sarah Novotny, Sheeri K. Cabral, Tim Callaghan.</p>
<p>The committee communicates throughout the nomination and voting process to exchange views and opinions.</p>
<h4>The awards</h4>
<p>Awards are traditionally (as in this year) donated by some party, who's identity remains secret.</p>
<h4>Support</h4>
<p>This is a community effort; we ask for your support in spreading the word and of course in nominating candidates. Thanks!</p>
