<p><a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/">openark.org blog</a> is now five years old. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Throughout these five years I posted almost exclusively MySQL oriented blogs, though I had every intention of writing on various engineering topics.</p>
<p>I still see blogging as one of the most important forms of knowledge sharing, and indeed for me the blogs aggregated at <a href="http://planet.mysql.com/">Planet MySQL</a> are my main source of MySQL information. I especially like to read technical content straight from the developer; but am also keen on being updated with news on conferences, releases, distributions and some insightful opinions.</p>
<p>The advent of the Stack Exchange websites makes for a common place where people get to learn "how to issue this query" or "how replication works". I can see the <a href="http://dba.stackexchange.com/">DBA site</a> gaining popularity, though still going slow. Eventually I suspect it will be the one place where people share their questions and answers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless blogging is a great way of sharing a new finding of yours; express an opinion; review a product. So I hope for five more years of active blogging, and thank the readers of this blog for keeping watch!</p>
<p>Some numbers: to date I've posted <strong>296</strong> MySQL related posts (so <strong>1.13</strong> blog posts per week, evenly spread). The vast majority were technical; and a few opinions. I posted <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/?s=tales+of+the+trade">6 comic strips</a>; most of which were, I'm afraid, largely misunderstood  (the blame is on me) and projected exactly the opposite perception I was trying to express. I'm bound to fail again.</p>
<p>Traffic can be better (not sharing all my secrets). Been a slow down in the past months. I know, I haven't produced much <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/sql-pie-chart">Pie charts</a> lately.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for reading or commenting. No point in blogging if no one pays attention to your blabbering! And do keep coming :)</p>
<p>&lt;/meta-post&gt;</p>
