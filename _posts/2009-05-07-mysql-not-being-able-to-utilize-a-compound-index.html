<p>I came today upon a very strange issue. It seems like MySQL is unable to utilize a compound index when evaluating a plan for a query with a range condition. I'm looking for an explanation. I'll appreciate any insight on this.</p>
<p><!--more-->Take a look at the following table:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>CREATE TABLE `t` (
  `a` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  `b` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  `c` int(11) default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`a`,`b`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Filled with this data:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM t;
+---+---+------+
| a | b | c    |
+---+---+------+
| 1 | 1 | NULL |
| 1 | 2 | NULL |
| 1 | 3 | NULL |
| 1 | 4 | NULL |
| 1 | 5 | NULL |
| 2 | 1 | NULL |
| 2 | 2 | NULL |
| 2 | 3 | NULL |
| 2 | 4 | NULL |
| 2 | 5 | NULL |
+---+---+------+
10 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is known that I can query by tuples:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM t WHERE (a,b) &lt; (2,2);
+---+---+------+
| a | b | c    |
+---+---+------+
| 1 | 1 | NULL |
| 1 | 2 | NULL |
| 1 | 3 | NULL |
| 1 | 4 | NULL |
| 1 | 5 | NULL |
| 2 | 1 | NULL |
+---+---+------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>MySQL understands tuple comparison (e.g. <strong>(a,b) &lt; (2.2)</strong>) and returns correct results. Now here's my issue: I would assume the PRIMARY KEY is used - since it's on <strong>(a,b)</strong> - so that's a simple (well, compound) range condition. Alas:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t WHERE (a,b) &lt; (2,2)G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: SIMPLE
        table: t
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 10
        Extra: Using where
1 row in set (0.00 sec)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>We get a full table scan! Now, MySQL has no problem when I do an <em>equality</em> search (e.g. <strong>(a,b) = (2,2)</strong>). In that case, the PRIMARY KEY <em>is</em> utilized.</p>
<p>Why, then, would it not use it in the range query? Why would it not consider it as a possible key (I could live with FORCE KEY if that would solve the problem). This problem undermines some efforts of mine for nice optimization tricks.</p>
<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: the above is a simplified version of a very large table I was using (~50M rows, ~30GB), and on which same results were achieved]</p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions?</p>
