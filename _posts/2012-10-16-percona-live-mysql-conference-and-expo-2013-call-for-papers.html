<p>I'm honored to accept the role of conference chairman in the upcoming <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/">Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo</a>, April 22th-25th, 2013, Santa Clara, CA. Here are a few administrative announcements:</p>
<h4>Call for Papers</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/node/add/session">Call for papers</a> is extended until <strong>Oct 31st</strong>. We've already received a good number of submissions, but wish to provide with another chance for latecomers. Now is a good time to submit!</p>
<p>The committee will begin the long reviewing process shortly.</p>
<h4>Committee</h4>
<p>Members of the reviewing committee are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roland Bouman (Pentaho)</li>
<li>Ronald Bradford (Continuent)</li>
<li>Laine Campbell (PalominoDB)</li>
<li>Colin Charles (MontyProgram)</li>
<li>Jeremey Cole (Twitter)</li>
<li>Patrick Galbraith (HP)</li>
<li>Henrik Ingo (Nokia)</li>
<li>Jay Janssen (Percona)</li>
<li>Giuseppe Maxia (Continuent)</li>
<li>Domas Mituzas (Facebook)</li>
<li>Ivan Zoratti (SkySQL)</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more-->The committee is charged with reviewing submitted papers so as to make sure we pick great talks for this conference and have a balanced and appealing schedule for any attendee. These people are about to spend a good deal of their private time on this, and much of the conference's success will be their own!</p>
<h4>Papers</h4>
<p>If you're still about to submit, then please review these guidelines from previous conferences as for how to best get your paper accepted: <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-to-get-your-proposal-accepted-to.html">[1],</a> <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2009/12/19/how-to-write-a-good-mysql-conference-proposal/">[2]</a>, <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/percona-live-mysql-conference-and-expo-2012-a-note-on-proposals">[3]</a></p>
<p>Remember the best guideline the committee has, when evaluating your talk, is your submission. Who you are or the company you work for do not make for an accepted paper.</p>
<p>We may ask for clarifications, or suggest that you rewrite parts of your submission, so please be attentive. But it is absolutely best if your paper is well drafted on submission (BTW, you can edit your submission right now before the committee begins its reviews).</p>
<p>The session/tutorial tracks are: Developing Applications, Database Administration, Trends in Architecture and Design, Tools, Utilizing Hardware, New Features, Best Practices for Businesses, Replication and High Availability Strategies. If you're not sure where your submission fits in, please add a private note. The committee may choose to pick the most suitable track for you.</p>
<p>See you at the conference!</p>
