<p>I would like to get the community's opinion about supporting older (minor) versions of MySQL in open source projects.</p>
<p>If I were to develop some open source project, and a bug report came which only applied to MySQL <strong>5.0.51</strong> (but more recent versions worked fine), would I need to fix the code so as to support this older version?</p>
<p>How about supporting <strong>5.0.22</strong> (released almost 4 years ago, with almost 70 revisions since)? Would you expect an open source project to support this MySQL version because, say, this is the <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/to-not-yum-or-to-not-apt-get">default version in your yum repository</a>?</p>
<p>I would like to concentrate on the currently stable MySQL versions: <strong>5.0</strong> and <strong>5.1</strong>. Versions <strong>4.x</strong> are out of the question for me, and <strong>5.5</strong> is not yet GA.</p>
<p>Sure, it would be great to support <em>everything</em>. But also time and effort consuming. So, I would greatly appreciate <em>your feedback</em>!<br />
