<p><strong>Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Alibaba, MariaDB, Percona team up and offer Oracle all public changes under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt">Apache CCLA</a></strong></p>
<p>Read again please.</p>
<p>My one word summary of this is: Romantic. In the most positive sense.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer; this is my understanding of the current status and of the offer.</em></p>
<p>Summarizing the deal: the teams participating with WebScaleSQL would like to push code upstream. Current legal issues limit their options. Existing patches/contributions from Percona &amp; MariaDB are licensed by GPLv2, which Oracle cannot import as it distributes a commercial, closed source, edition, in addition to its open source MySQL community edition.</p>
<p>So what happens is that there is a lot of free code, great patches, new features out there, that are only available via MariaDB or WebscaleSQL or Percona Server, but not in the Oracle MySQL code base. This, in turn, means Oracle re-implements many features originating from said companies. And, more importantly, said companies need to routinely rebase their code on new Oracle releases, repeating tedious work.</p>
<p>The offer is that Oracle agrees to the Apache CCLA as a license by which it would be able to incorporate contributions. Oracle would then be able to use incorporated code in both open source and commercial edition. Oracle will choose what code to incorporate; hopefully many patches will be accepted upstream, and the community will benefit from a rich featureset, rapid developed MySQL server.</p>
<p>Clearly a lot of work, persuasion, lawyer time, discussions etc. have been invested in this effort. I would like to add my humble <strong>+1/like/favorite/whathaveyou</strong>. You may add yours by letting Oracle know your opinion on the subject. Media tools are great for this.</p>
