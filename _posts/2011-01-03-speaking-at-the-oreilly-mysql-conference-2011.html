<p>I'm very pleased and humbled to announce that my submission to the upcoming O'Reilly MySQL Conference, April 2011, has been accepted.</p>
<p>I will present a 45 minute session titled <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/detail/17155"><strong>openark-kit: MySQL utilities for everyday use</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In this session, I will present some of the tools in the <em>openark kit</em>. We'll discuss some limitations of the MySQL server, and how openark kit tools overcome those limitations and provide with solutions to common maintenance and audit problems.</p>
<p>This will be a technical session and will discuss various topics of the MySQL server: security, execution plans, replication, triggers and more. I do not intend to discuss all tools, nor to cover the various options. Instead, I'll present the "<em>behind the scenes</em>", show <em>why the tools work</em>, present common problems and typical use case.</p>
<p>This will be the first time I present at the MySQL Conference (or any conference outside Israel, for that matter). I hope to have a good session. As extra measure of safety, I'll bring along a couple basketballs; if the sun shines, we can all go outside and have a good time!</p>
<p>The idea to submit this talk (credit Roland Bouman) has given me the inspiration to put effort in making a new release with new and updated tools. So this talk is already a success as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
