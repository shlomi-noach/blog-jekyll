<p>The following is a sample my.cnf configuration file. It includes some common and uncommon parameters, along with occasional comments.</p>
<p>You can use this file, and tune as appropriate for your machine, operating system, and application needs.</p>
<p>In particular, note the high values set for the InnoDB related parameters, below, and change them to match your system and application's requirements. You have been warned.<!--more--></p>

port            = 3306</strong><br />
# The following location is not the default location for many<br />
# pre-packaged utilities. For example, mytop or mysqlreport<br />
# (or any Perl or Python based client, for that matter), will<br />
# NOT look in the /tmp path for the mysql.sock file.<br />
# The value is set to common location by your RPM or DEB<br />
# package on GNU/Linux, yet defaults to the following in the<br />
# .tgz mysql-server downlaod files.<br />
<strong> socket          = /tmp/mysql.sock</strong></p>
<p><strong>default-character-set=utf8</strong></p>
<p><strong>[mysqld]</strong></p>
<p># For a new installation, best to use a strict sql_mode:</p>
<p><strong>sql_mode=TRADITIONAL<br />
datadir= [path to mysql data]<br />
</strong># I prefer working case-sensitive. However, some 3rd party tools<br />
# demand case insensitivity. If you're working with such a tool,<br />
# uncomment the following line.<br />
<strong>#lower_case_table_names=1</strong></p>
<p># 5-10 minutes timeout is usually more than required for idle<br />
# connections. If a connection can be idle for so long, then<br />
# creating a new connection is usually very cheap. This applies<br />
# for many common web based applications. However, depending<br />
# on your application, you may wish to set this parameter to a<br />
# higher value.<br />
<strong> wait_timeout=300</strong></p>
<p># The following is unfortunately still used on many instances. If<br />
# you need backwards compatability, you may need to uncomment<br />
# the following line.<br />
<strong> #old_passwords=1</strong></p>
<p># generic configuration options<br />
<strong> port            = 3306</strong><br />

# The following values are liberal. You may reduce them<br />
# according to your needs.<br />
# NOTE: verify that your OS's open files limit is at least as<br />
# specified here.<br />
# I usually set 'ulimit -n' to allow for 8192 files to mysql.<br />
<strong>open_files_limit = 8000<br />
</strong># The following is usually cheap, so go ahead and set a high value.<br />
<strong>table_cache = 2048<br />
</strong># Connections take memory, so don;t be too liberal here. A common,<br />
# well tuned application, using proper connection pools, shouldn't<br />
# require more than 1000 concurrent connections.<br />
<strong>max_connections = 500</strong></p>
<p># Memory:<br />
# When required, the following parameters will be used to allocate<br />
# more memory. The value specified is always the amount of memory<br />
# allocated, regardless of the real need.<br />

# applications where the query cache almost utterly unused<br />
# (due to frequent invalidation). Check for your hit:insert ratio.<br />
# A query cache type of value "2" (DEMAND) is a more programmatic<br />
# oriented setting, where most queries are not cached, but a few,<br />
# recognized to benefit from the query cache, are executed with<br />
# the SQL_CACHE flag.<br />

<p># Logs<br />
# Having log-bin enabled allows for replication and for point in time<br />
# recovery. It's a good idea to always have binary logs at hand.<br />
# binary logs can also be reviewed to see what kind of modifications<br />
# are made on your database (the general query log also logs<br />
# SELECTs and other queries, which do not appear in the binary log)<br />
# I usually name the logs after my host name. When dealing with<br />
# replication, having master and slave logs named after the machines<br />
# on which they are running makes for clearer distinction between<br />
# them.<br />

# high and not too low for you, depending on your backups frequency<br />
# and maximum slave lag.<br />

<p># Replication related settings:<br />
# Unique server identification number between 1 and 2^32-1.<br />
<strong>server-id = [a unique number]<br />
</strong># Setting the report_host allows for SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on the master<br />
# to see which slaves are connected.<br />
<strong>report_host=[machine's ip]<br />
</strong># Limit the total size of the relay logs: set this value to a high enough<br />
# value. When the slave can't keep up with the master, the relay logs<br />
# fill up. If no limit is set, all disk space can be consumed.<br />
# If a value too low is set, the master's binary logs cannot (shouldn't)<br />
# be purged, and so the master gets to have a disk space problem. So<br />
# provide a high enough value, and monitor your disk space!<br />
