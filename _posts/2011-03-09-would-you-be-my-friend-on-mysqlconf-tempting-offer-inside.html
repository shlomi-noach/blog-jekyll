<p>I'm still throwing papers to the trash and starting all over, fixing, rewriting and improving my talk at <a href="http://www.mysqlconf.com/">mysqlconf 2011</a>, where I will be presenting <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/schedule/detail/17155">openark-kit: MySQL utilities for everyday use</a>.</p>
<p>However I've got something up my sleeve: a benefit many can enjoy, that'll make me a respectful, popular and sought after speaker. While others may try and lure you with such <em>earthly</em> temptations as a <strong>20%</strong> off discount, I am in a position to offer you a more <em>spiritual</em> gift: my friendship!</p>
<p>See, if you become my friend, I can offer you a <strong>25%</strong> discount on the MySQL conference. Yes, that's <strong>5%</strong> more than my competitors! The only thing I ask in return is that you be my friend (hey, it's called "friends of speaker"). Not like a FB virtual friend, but a <em>real</em> friendship! One where you can buy me <em>beer</em> or <em>dinner</em>!</p>
<p>If you agree to such humane terms, I will be in the position to let you know that all you have to do is fill in <strong>﻿﻿﻿mys11fsd</strong> in your registration form.</p>
<p>No, wait! I let it slip! Rewrite: You should fill in <del><strong>﻿﻿﻿mys11fsd </strong></del><em>[will only tell you this password after your commitment to a beer]</em> in your registration form.</p>
<p><em>Oh no, not again! </em></p>
<p>Don't use <a href="https://en.oreilly.com/mysql2011/public/regwith/mys11fsd"><strong>﻿﻿﻿mys11fsd</strong></a> without talking to me first... You're not supposed to... <em>Oh, my beer!</em></p>
<p><em>Argghhh!</em></p>
