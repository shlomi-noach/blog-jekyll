<p>The MySQL Community Awards initiative is an effort to acknowledge and thank individuals and corporates for their contributions to the MySQL ecosystem. It is a from-the-community, by-the-community and for-the-community effort. The committee is composed of an independent group of community members of different orientation and opinion, themselves past winners or known contributors to the community.</p>
<p>The 2016 community awards were presented on April 21st, 2016, during the keynotes at the Percona Live conference. The winners are:</p>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Community Contributor of the year 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bill Karwin<br />
</strong>Bill has been working with the community for years, helping them understand SQL. Bill is the author of the great book "SQL Antipatterns". He has given a large amount of help on sites such as StackOverflow, Quora, and of course many conference talks. Bill has provided a huge amount of help to the community directly.</li>
<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Domas Mituzas<br />
</strong>Domas Mituzas started in the MySQL ecosystem as a MySQL Support Engineer at MySQL AB. Since he had some spare time, he did a lot of work to scale MySQL at Wikipedia. He is now a small data engineer at Facebook, mostly working with user-facing data systems. He continues to write very interesting blog posts and bug reports. Domas is responsible for giving us MyDumper, PoorMansProfiler, and the infamous Query Cache tuner!</li>
<li><strong>Yoshinori Matsunobu<br />
</strong>Yoshinori Matsunobu is currently leading the MyRocks effort to get the RocksDB storage engine for MySQL into production at Facebook. Previously (amongst his other accomplishments) he created HandlerSocket, and implemented MHA to support failover automation for MySQL – both of which have been used at many companies. He is a frequent speaker at community events, and his tutorials and slide decks do a lot to increase expertise in the community. He is a frequent bug reporter with a focus on replication (RBR, semi-sync).</li>
</ul>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Application of the year 2016</h4>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MaxScale</strong><br />
MariaDB MaxScale is an Open Source dynamic routing gateway. It is widely used as a database load balancer for Galera Cluster deployments, for standard replication setups, and as a replication relay. It has a modular architecture which includes plugins for read-write splitting and query logging. It serves a variety of tasks, from load balancing to database firewall filtering to binlog server and is widely used in production in large topologies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>MySQL Community Awards: Corporate Contributor of the year 2016</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Booking.com</strong><br />
Booking.com has been a massive contributor to the MySQL ecosystem, sending many of their excellent DBAs to various conferences to talk. They have provided an innovative test bed for testing out, and giving a wealth of invaluable feedback about new releases (across a wide variety of MySQL and related software projects). Booking.com contributes to Open Source foundations, projects and communities by donating, sponsoring, making code contributions and hosting events. The quality of MySQL is undoubtedly much better today because of their help and input.</li>
