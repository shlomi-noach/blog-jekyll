<p>This is the <strong>2nd</strong> sneak preview of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema">common_schema</a>'s <strong>rdebug</strong>: debugger &amp; debugging API for MySQL stored routines (<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/mysql-stored-routines-debugger-debugging-api-sneak-preview-video">see <strong>1st</strong> preview here</a>).</p>
<p><em>rdebug</em> will be released as part of <em>common_schema</em>, free and open sourced.</p>
<p>In this sneak preview I present:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiling multiple routines with debug info</li>
<li>Starting/stopping a debug session</li>
<li>Step-over, step-in, step-out</li>
<li>Showing stack trace</li>
<li>Showing the next-statement to execute</li>
<li>Viewing and manipulating local routine variables</li>
<li>Misc. meta routines</li>
</ul>
<h4>The quick technical overview</h4>
<p><em>rdebug</em> is a server-side mechanism, itself written in MySQL stored routines. It manipulates your routines by injecting debug code (easily removed afterwards).</p>
<p>To debug a routine you will need two connections: one is the debugging connection, and the other is the worker connection. The debugger connection attaches itself to the worker connection, where your routines execute.</p>
<p><em>rdebug</em> is controlled by an <strong>API</strong> of stored routines. This means any GUI tool may choose to use <em>rdebug</em> as its routine debugging mechanism. Your are not bound to a specific tool, a specific OS or framework. You may choose to invoke the API via command line, if you like; it's all in your server.</p>
<h4>A video is worth a thousand blogs<!--more--></h4>
<p>The following video demonstrates the debugging process of two stored procedures, one invoking the other. This allows for step-in/over/out commands, stack trace analysis, and of course variable inspection and modification.</p>
<p>I can't say I caught the hang of capturing my desktop and editing the movie (doing it one on Linux and once on Mac), so please excuse any poor quality video/sound.</p>

<p>The code is not yet released, but will be, shortly, under an open source license.</p>
