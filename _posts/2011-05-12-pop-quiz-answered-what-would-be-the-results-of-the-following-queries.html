<p>The quiz presented poses with an uncommon, though valid SQL syntax: <em>one is allowed to use quoted name aliases</em>. Thus, it is valid to write:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT Name AS 'n', Continent AS 'c' FROM countries</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>But what does the above mean? Let's see the results of our three questions:<!--more--></p>
<h4>Question #1</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT
  id,
  Name AS 'n',
  Continent AS 'c'
FROM
  countries
ORDER BY
  c
;
+----+--------------------------+---------------+
| id | n                        | c             |
+----+--------------------------+---------------+
| 15 | North Korea              | Asia          |
| 12 | Nepal                    | Asia          |
| 11 | Norway                   | Europe        |
| 10 | Netherlands              | Europe        |
|  8 | Nicaragua                | North America |
|  1 | Netherlands Antilles     | North America |
|  3 | Namibia                  | Africa        |
|  5 | Niger                    | Africa        |
|  7 | Nigeria                  | Africa        |
|  9 | Niue                     | Oceania       |
|  4 | New Caledonia            | Oceania       |
|  2 | Northern Mariana Islands | Oceania       |
| 13 | Nauru                    | Oceania       |
| 14 | New Zealand              | Oceania       |
|  6 | Norfolk Island           | Oceania       |
+----+--------------------------+---------------</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Result is sorted by continent, as may be expected. We have aliased continent as <strong>'c'</strong>, and <strong>ORDER BY c</strong> went well. The quotes were meaningless here.</p>
<h4>Question #2</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT
  MIN(Name) AS 'n',
  Continent AS 'c'
FROM
  countries
GROUP BY
  c
;
+----------------------+---------------+
| n                    | c             |
+----------------------+---------------+
| Nepal                | Asia          |
| Netherlands          | Europe        |
| Netherlands Antilles | North America |
| Namibia              | Africa        |
| Nauru                | Oceania       |
+----------------------+---------------+</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As with first query, the quoted <strong>'c'</strong> acts just like non-quoted <strong>c</strong>.</p>
<h4>Question #3</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT
  MIN(Name) AS 'n',
  Continent AS 'c'
FROM
  countries
GROUP BY
  'c'
;
+---------+---------------+
| n       | c             |
+---------+---------------+
| Namibia | North America |
+---------+---------------+</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously something went wrong here. The query is valid, yet returns a single row. Why is that?</p>
<p>What we've just done is to group by the <em>constant</em> <strong>'c'</strong>, not on the <em>alias</em> <strong>c</strong>. Results are complete wrong.</p>
<p>This query is a simplified version of a true customer's query. The <strong>GROUP BY</strong> clause included some <strong>5</strong> fields, the constant literal being one of them. The results of that query were used in very important business decision making. Well, decisions were misinformed...</p>
<h4>Quoted aliases?</h4>
<p>I'm not sure why anyone would want these. Why is this even a valid syntax?</p>
<p>Multi-word aliases? Seems like wrong coding convention. But, if you must, do not use single quotes: use <em>`backticks`</em>.</p>
