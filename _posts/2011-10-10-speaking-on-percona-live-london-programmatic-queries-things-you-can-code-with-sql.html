<p>I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/">Percona Live</a> event, held in London, October <strong>24, 25, 2011</strong>.</p>
<p>My session is called <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2011/session/programmatic-queries-things-you-can-code-with-sql/">Programmatic Queries: things you can code with SQL</a>. It's a short <strong>30</strong> minute talk, in which I present underlying knowledge of the programmatic nature of SQL queries within MySQL, and how to take advantage of such knowledge so as to build faster, shorter, and sometimes unexpected queries.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> about stored routine programming, a classic programmatic aspect of MySQL, but rather about expected order of execution: of row evaluation, of control flow statements, of table inference, of time issues.</p>
<p>I have far too many examples, some real-world problem solvers, and some less common in daily use, to be able to deliver them all on this session. I will pick up those which seem most interesting to me, or those best presenting the programmatic nature of the query. As time allows I may add more examples, or look into interesting future possibilities.</p>
<p>I hope to see you there.</p>
