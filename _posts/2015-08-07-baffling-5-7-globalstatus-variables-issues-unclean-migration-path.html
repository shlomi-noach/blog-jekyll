<p>MySQL <strong>5.7</strong> introduces a change in the way we query for global variables and status variables: the <strong>INFORMATION_SCHEMA.(GLOBAL|SESSION)_(VARIABLES|STATUS)</strong> tables are now deprecated and empty. Instead, we are to use the respective <strong>performance_schema.(global|session)_(variables|status)</strong> tables.</p>
<p>But the change goes farther than that; there is also a security change. Oracle created a pitfall of <strong>2</strong> changes at the same time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Variables/status moved to a different table</li>
<li>Privileges required on said table</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, my non-root user gets:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; show session variables like 'tx_isolation';
ERROR 1142 (42000): SELECT command denied to user 'normal_user'@'my_host' for table 'session_variables'</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Who gets affected by this? Nearly <em>everyone and everything</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Nagios will not be able to read status variables</li>
<li>Your ORM will not be able to determine session variables</li>
<li>Your replication user will fail connecting (see <a href="http://datacharmer.blogspot.nl/2015/08/mysql-578-features-bugs-and-rumors.html">this post by Giuseppe</a>)</li>
<li>And most everyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with the above is that involves two unrelated changes to your setup, which are not entirely simple to coordinate:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change your app code to choose the correct schema (information_schema vs. performance_schema)</li>
<li><strong>GRANT</strong> the permissions on your database</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps at this point you still do not consider this to be a problem. You may be thinking: <em>well, let's first prepare by creating the GRANTs, and once that is in place, we can, at our leisure, modify the code</em>.</p>
<p>Not so fast. Can you really that simply create those GRANTs?<!--more--></p>
<h3>Migration woes</h3>
<p>How do you migrate to a new MySQL version? You do not reinstall all your servers. You want an easy migration path, and that path is: introduce one or two slaves of a newer version, see that everything works to your satisfaction, slowly upgrade all your other slaves, eventually switchover/upgrade your master.</p>
<p>This should not be any different for <strong>5.7</strong>. We would like to provision a <strong>5.7</strong> slave in our topologies and just see that everything works. Well, we have, and things don't just work. Our Nagios stops working for that <strong>5.7</strong> slave. <em>Orchestrator</em> started complaining (by this time I've <a href="https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator/releases/tag/v1.4.291">already fixed it</a> to be more tolerant for the <strong>5.7</strong> problems so no crashes here).</p>
<p>I hope you see the problem by now.</p>
<blockquote><p>You cannot issue a <strong>GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.global_variables TO '...'</strong> on your <strong>5.6</strong> master.</p></blockquote>
<p>The table simply does not exist there, which means the statement will not go to binary logs, which means it will not replicate on your <strong>5.7</strong> slave, which means you will not be able to <strong>SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES</strong> on your slave, which means everything remains broken.</p>
<p>Yes, you can issue this directly on your <strong>5.7</strong> slaves. It's <em>doable</em>, but <em>undesired</em>. It's ugly in terms of automation (and will quite possibly break some assumptions and sanity checks your automation uses); in terms of validity testing. It's unfriendly to GTID (make sure to <strong>SET SQL_LOG_BIN=0</strong> before that).</p>
<h3>WHY in the first place?</h3>
<p>It seems like a security thing. I'm not sure whether this was intended. So you prevent a <strong>SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES</strong> for a normal user. Makes sense. And yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; show global variables like 'hostname';
ERROR 1142 (42000): SELECT command denied to user 'normal_user'@'my_host' for table 'global_variables'

mysql&gt; select @@global.hostname;
+---------------------+
| @@global.hostname   |
+---------------------+
| myhost.mydomain.com |
+---------------------+

mysql&gt; select @@version;
+--------------+
| @@version    |
+--------------+
| 5.7.8-rc-log |
+--------------+

</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like I'm allowed access to that info after all. So it's not strictly a security design decision. For status variable, I admit, I don't have a similar workaround.</p>
<h3>Solutions?</h3>
<p>The following are meant to be solutions, but do not really solve the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHOW</strong> commands. <strong>SHOW GLOBAL|SESSION VARIABLES|STATUS</strong> will work properly, and will implicitly know whether to provide the results via <strong>information_schema</strong> or <strong>performance_schema</strong> tables.
<ul>
<li>But, aren't we meant to be happier with <strong>SELECT</strong> queries? So that I can really do stuff that is smarter than <strong>LIKE 'variable_name%'</strong>?</li>
<li>And of course you cannot use <strong>SHOW</strong> in server side cursors. Your stored routines are in a mess now.</li>
<li>This does not solve the GRANTs problem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_show_compatibility_56">show_compatibility_56</a></strong>: an introduced variable in <strong>5.7</strong>, boolean. It truly is a time-travel-paradox novel in disguise, in multiple respects.
<ul>
<li>Documentation introduces it, and says it is deprecated.
<ul>
<li>time-travel-paradox :O</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But it actually works in <strong>5.7.8</strong> (latest)
<ul>
<li>time-travel-paradox plot thickens</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your automation scripts do not know in advance whether your MySQL has this variable
<ul>
<li>Hence <strong>SELECT @@global.show_compatibility_56</strong> will produce an error on <strong>5.6</strong></li>
<li>But the "safe" way of <strong>SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES LIKE 'show_compatibility_56'</strong> will fail on a privilege error on <strong>5.7</strong></li>
<li>time-travel-paradox :O</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Actually advised by my colleague Simon J. Mudd, <strong>show_compatibility_56</strong> defaults to <strong>OFF</strong>. I <em>support</em> this line of thought. Or else it's <strong>old_passwords=1</strong> all over again.</li>
<li><strong>show_compatibility_56</strong> doesn't solve the GRANTs problem.</li>
<li>This does not solve any migration path. It just postpones the moment when I will hit the same problem. When I flip the variable from <strong>"1"</strong> to <strong>"0"</strong>, I'm back at square one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Suggestion</h3>
<p>I claim security is not the issue, as presented above. I claim Oracle will yet again fall into the trap of no-easy-way-to-migrate-to-GTID in <strong>5.6</strong> if the current solution is unchanged. I claim that there have been too many changes at once. Therefore, I suggest one of the alternative two flows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flow 1</strong>: keep <strong>information_schema</strong>, later migration into <strong>performance_schema</strong>
<ul>
<li>In <strong>5.7</strong>, <strong>information_schema</strong> tables should still produce the data.</li>
<li>No security constraints on <strong>information_schema</strong></li>
<li>Generate WARNINGs on reading from <strong>information_schema</strong> ("...this will be deprecated...")</li>
<li><strong>performance_schema </strong><em>also available</em>. With security constraints, whatever.</li>
<li>In <strong>5.8</strong> remove <strong>information_schema</strong> tables; we are left with <strong>performance_schema</strong> only.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Flow 2</strong>: easy migration into <strong>performance_schema</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In <strong>5.7</strong>, <strong>performance_schema</strong> tables should not require any special privileges. Any user can read from them.</li>
<li>Keep <strong>show_compatibility_56 </strong>as it is.</li>
<li><strong>SHOW</strong> commands choose between <strong>information_schema</strong> or <strong>performance_schema</strong> on their own -- just as things are done now.</li>
<li>In <strong>5.8</strong>, <strong>performance_schema</strong> tables will require <strong>SELECT</strong> privileges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, I love the work done by the engineers; and I love how they listen to the community.</p>
<p>Comments are most welcome. Have I missed the simple solution here? Are there even more complications to these features? Thoughts on my suggested two flows?</p>
