<p>Following <a href="http://everythingmysql.ning.com/profiles/blogs/restore-one-table-from-an-all">Restore one table from an ALL database dump</a> and <a href="http://gtowey.blogspot.com/2009/11/restore-single-table-from-mysqldump.html">Restore a Single Table From mysqldump</a>, I would like to add my own thoughts and comments on the subject.</p>
<p>I also wish to note performance issues with the two suggested solutions, and offer improvements.</p>
<h4>Problem relevance</h4>
<p>While the problem is interesting, I just want to note that it is relevant in very specific database dimensions. Too small - and it doesn't matter how you solve it (e.g. just open vi/emacs and copy+paste). Too big - and it would not be worthwhile to restore from <em>mysqldump</em> anyway. I would suggest that the problem is interesting in the whereabouts of a few dozen GB worth of data.</p>
<h4>Problem recap</h4>
<p>Given a dump file (generated by mysqldump), how do you restore a single table, without making any changes to other tables?</p>
<p>Let's review the two referenced solutions. I'll be using the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employee.html">employees db</a> on <a href="https://launchpad.net/mysql-sandbox">mysql-sandbox</a> for testing. I'll choose a very small table to restore: <strong>departments</strong> (only a few rows in this table).</p>
<h4>Security based solution</h4>
<p><a href="http://everythingmysql.ning.com/profiles/blogs/restore-one-table-from-an-all"><strong>Chris</strong></a> offers to create a special purpose account, which will only have write (CREATE, INSERT, etc.) privileges on the particular table to restore. Cool hack! But, I'm afraid, not too efficient, for two reasons:<!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>MySQL needs to process all irrelevant queries (ALTER, INSERT, ...) only to disallow them due to access violation errors.</li>
<li>Assuming restore is from remote host, we overload the network with all said irrelevant queries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just how inefficient? Let's time it:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; grant usage on *.* to 'restoreuser'@'localhost';
mysql&gt; grant select on *.* to 'restoreuser'@'localhost';
mysql&gt; grant all on employees.departments to 'restoreuser'@'localhost';

<p>So, at about <strong>30</strong> seconds to restore a 9 rows table.</p>
<h4>Text filtering based solution.</h4>
<p><a href="http://gtowey.blogspot.com/2009/11/restore-single-table-from-mysqldump.html"><strong>gtowey</strong></a> offers parsing the dump file beforehand:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, parse with <em>grep</em>, to detect rows where tables are referenced within dump file</li>
<li>Second, parse with <em>sed</em>, extracting relevant rows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's time this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$ time grep -n 'Table structure' /tmp/employees.sql
23:-- Table structure for table `departments`
48:-- Table structure for table `dept_emp`
89:-- Table structure for table `dept_manager`

</blockquote>
<p>Much faster: about <strong>1</strong> second, compared to <strong>30</strong> seconds from above.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find two issues here:</p>
<ol>
<li>A correctness problem: this solution somewhat assumes that there's only a single table with desired name. I say "somewhat" since it leaves this for the user.</li>
<li>An efficiency problem: it reads the dump file <em>twice</em>. First parsing it with <em>grep</em>, then with <em>sed</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>A third solution</h4>
<p><em>sed</em> is much stronger than presented. In fact, the inquiry made by <em>grep</em> in gtowey's solution can be easily handled by <em>sed</em>:</p>

<h4>A third solution</h4>
<p><em>sed</em> is much stronger than presented. In fact, the inquiry made by <em>grep</em> in gtowey's solution can be easily handled by <em>sed</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
/,/^-- Table structure for table/p" /tmp/employees.sql | ./use employees

real    <strong>0m0.573s</strong>
user    0m0.416s
sys     0m0.152s</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the <strong>"/^-- Table structure for table \`departments\`/,/^-- Table structure for table/p"</strong> part tells <em>sed</em> to only print those rows starting from the <strong>departments</strong> table structure, and ending in the next table structure (this is for clarity: had department been the last table, there would not be a next table, but we could nevertheless solve this using other anchors).</p>
<p>And, we only do it in <strong>0.57</strong> seconds: about half the time of previous attempt.</p>
<p>Now, just to be more correct, we only wish to consider the <strong>employees.department</strong> table. So, <em>assuming</em> there's more than one database dumped (and, by consequence, <strong>USE</strong> statements in the dump-file), we use:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>cat /tmp/employees.sql | sed -n "/^USE <p>Following <a href="http://everythingmysql.ning.com/profiles/blogs/restore-one-table-from-an-all">Restore one table from an ALL database dump</a> and <a href="http://gtowey.blogspot.com/2009/11/restore-single-table-from-mysqldump.html">Restore a Single Table From mysqldump</a>, I would like to add my own thoughts and comments on the subject.</p>

I'll be using the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employee.html">employees db</a> on <a href="https://launchpad.net/mysql-sandbox">mysql-sandbox</a> for testing. I'll choose a very small table to restore: <strong>departments</strong> (only a few rows in this table).</p>
<h4>Security based solution</h4>
<p><a href="http://everythingmysql.ning.com/profiles/blogs/restore-one-table-from-an-all"><strong>Chris</strong></a> offers to create a special purpose account, which will only have write (CREATE, INSERT, etc.) privileges on the particular table to restore.

<ol>
<li>MySQL needs to process all irrelevant queries (ALTER, INSERT, ...) only to disallow them due to access violation errors.</li>
<li>Assuming restore is from remote host, we overload the network with all said irrelevant queries.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just how inefficient? Let's time it:</p>
<blockquote>

mysql&gt; grant select on *.* to 'restoreuser'@'localhost';
mysql&gt; grant all on employees.departments to 'restoreuser'@'localhost';

<p>So, at about <strong>30</strong> seconds to restore a 9 rows table.</p>
<h4>Text filtering based solution.</h4>
<p><a href="http://gtowey.blogspot.com/2009/11/restore-single-table-from-mysqldump.html"><strong>gtowey</strong></a> offers parsing the dump file beforehand:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, parse with <em>grep</em>, to detect rows where tables are referenced within dump file</li>
<li>Second, parse with <em>sed</em>, extracting relevant rows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's time this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$ time grep -n 'Table structure' /tmp/employees.sql
23:-- Table structure for table `departments`
48:-- Table structure for table `dept_emp`
89:-- Table structure for table `dept_manager`
117:-- Table structure for table `employees`
161:-- Table structure for table `salaries`
301:-- Table structure for table `titles`

real    <strong>0m0.397s</strong>
user    0m0.232s

real    <strong>0m0.562s</strong>
user    0m0.380s
sys     0m0.176s</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Much faster: about <strong>1</strong> second, compared to <strong>30</strong> seconds from above.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I find two issues here:</p>
<ol>
<li>A correctness problem: this solution somewhat assumes that there's only a single table with desired name. I say "somewhat" since it leaves this for the user.</li>
<li>An efficiency problem: it reads the dump file <em>twice</em>. First parsing it with <em>grep</em>, then with <em>sed</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>A third solution</h4>
<p><em>sed</em> is much stronger than presented. In fact, the inquiry made by <em>grep</em> in gtowey's solution can be easily handled by <em>sed</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
/,/^-- Table structure for table/p" /tmp/employees.sql | ./use employees

real    <strong>0m0.573s</strong>
user    0m0.416s
sys     0m0.152s</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the <strong>"/^-- Table structure for table \`departments\`/,/^-- Table structure for table/p"</strong> part tells <em>sed</em> to only print those rows starting from the <strong>departments</strong> table structure, and ending in the next table structure (this is for clarity: had department been the last table, there would not be a next table, but we could nevertheless solve this using other anchors).</p>
<p>And, we only do it in <strong>0.57</strong> seconds: about half the time of previous attempt.</p>
<p>Now, just to be more correct, we only wish to consider the <strong>employees.department</strong> table. So, <em>assuming</em> there's more than one database dumped (and, by consequence, <strong>USE</strong> statements in the dump-file), we use:</p>
<blockquote>
employees<p>Following <a href="http://everythingmysql.ning.com/profiles/blogs/restore-one-table-from-an-all">Restore one table from an ALL database dump</a> and <a href="http://gtowey.blogspot.com/2009/11/restore-single-table-from-mysqldump.html">Restore a Single Table From mysqldump</a>, I would like to add my own thoughts and comments on the subject.</p>
<p>I also wish to note performance issues with the two suggested solutions, and offer improvements.</p>
<h4>Problem relevance</h4>
<p>While the problem is interesting, I just want to note that it is relevant in very specific database dimensions. Too small - and it doesn't matter how you solve it (e.g. just open vi/emacs and copy+paste). Too big - and it would not be worthwhile to restore from <em>mysqldump</em> anyway. I would suggest that the problem is interesting in the whereabouts of a few dozen GB worth of data.</p>

<h4>A third solution</h4>
<p><em>sed</em> is much stronger than presented. In fact, the inquiry made by <em>grep</em> in gtowey's solution can be easily handled by <em>sed</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
/,/^-- Table structure for table/p" /tmp/employees.sql | ./use employees

real    <strong>0m0.573s</strong>
user    0m0.416s
sys     0m0.152s</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the <strong>"/^-- Table structure for table \`departments\`/,/^-- Table structure for table/p"</strong> part tells <em>sed</em> to only print those rows starting from the <strong>departments</strong> table structure, and ending in the next table structure (this is for clarity: had department been the last table, there would not be a next table, but we could nevertheless solve this using other anchors).</p>
<p>And, we only do it in <strong>0.57</strong> seconds: about half the time of previous attempt.</p>
<p>Now, just to be more correct, we only wish to consider the <strong>employees.department</strong> table. So, <em>assuming</em> there's more than one database dumped (and, by consequence, <strong>USE</strong> statements in the dump-file), we use:</p>
<blockquote>
/,/^-- Table structure for table/p" | ./use employees</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Further notes</h4>
<ul>
<li>All tests used warmed-up caches.</li>
<li>The sharp eyed readers would notice that <strong>departments</strong> is the first table in the dump file. Would that give an unfair advantage to the parsing-based restore methods? The answer is no. I've created an <strong>xdepartments</strong> table, to be located at the end of the dump. The difference in time is neglectful and inconclusive; we're still at ~0.58-0.59 seconds. The effect will be more visible on really large dumps; but then, so would the security-based effects.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Shell-Scripting-Arnold-Robbins/dp/0596005954/ref=sr_1_1"><img class="alignright" title="classic-shell-scripting" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/classic-shell-scripting.png" alt="classic-shell-scripting" width="144" height="189" /></a>Its is always best to test on large datasets, to get a feel on performance.</p>
<p>It's best to save MySQL the trouble of parsing &amp; ignoring statements. Scripting utilities like <em>sed</em>, <em>awk</em> &amp; <em>grep</em> have been around for ages, and are well optimized. They excel at text processing.</p>
<p>I've used <em>sed</em> many times in transforming dump outputs; for example, in converting MyISAM to InnoDB tables; to convert Antelope InnoDB tables to Barracuda format, etc. grep &amp; awk are also very useful.</p>
<p>May I recommend, at this point, reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Shell-Scripting-Arnold-Robbins/dp/0596005954/ref=sr_1_1">Classic Shell Scripting</a>, a very easy to follow book, which lists the most popular command line utilities like <em>grep</em>, <em>sed</em>, <em>awk</em>, <em>sort</em>, (countless more) and shell scripting in general. While most of these utilities are well known, the book excels in providing suprisingly practical, simple solution to common tasks.</p>
