<p>Revision <strong>208</strong> of <a href="../../forge/mycheckpoint">mycheckpoint</a>, a MySQL monitoring solution, has  been released. New and updated in this revision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggregation tables</strong>: aggregated data makes for fast reports on previously slow queries.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced charting</strong>: interactive charts now present time stamps dynamically (see <a href="http://mycheckpoint.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/html/sample/http/mcp_sql00/sv_report_html_brief"><strong>demo</strong></a>); "Zoom in" charts are available (see <a href="http://mycheckpoint.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/html/sample/http/mcp_sql00/zoom/questions"><strong>demo</strong></a>) on <em>mycheckpoint</em>'s HTTP server.</li>
<li><strong>RPM distribution</strong>: a "noarch" RPM <em>mycheckpoint</em> build is now available.</li>
<li>Initial work on formalizing test environment</li>
</ul>
<p><em>mycheckpoint</em> celebrates one year of existence!</p>
<h4>Aggregation tables</h4>
<p>I really wanted to avoid using these: everything was so more beautiful with one single dataset and dozens of supporting views (OK, the views themselves are hardly "beautiful").</p>
<p>However it was impossible (for my level of expertise) to optimize query performance what with all those views on per-hour and per-day aggregation. The GROUP BYs and the JOINs did not make it possible for condition pushdown (i.e. using MERGE algorithm) where desired.</p>
<p>As result, mycheckpoint now manages aggregation tables: per-hour and per-day. The impact on sample taking is neglect able (making for two additional fast queries), but the impact on reading aggregated data is overwhelming. Generating a HTML full report could take a few minutes to complete. It now returns in no time. This makes charting more attractive, and allows for enhanced charting, such as zooming in on charts, as described following.</p>
<p>Aggregation tables will automatically be created and retroactively populated upon using revision 208. There's nothing special to do; be advised that for one single execution of <em>mycheckpoint</em>, many INSERT queries are going to be executed. Shouldn't take more than a couple minutes on commodity hardware and a few months of history.</p>
<p>It is possible to disable aggregation tables, or make for a complete rebuild of tables; by default, though, aggregation is ON.</p>
<h4>Enhanced charting</h4>
<p>Two enhancements here:<!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>The interactive line charts already know how to update legend data as mouse hovers over them. Now they also present accurate date &amp; time. This provides with fully informative charts.</li>
<li>As with other monitoring tools, it is possible to "zoom in" on a chart: zooming in will present any chart in "last 24 hours", "last 10 days" and "complete history" views, magnified on screen. See <a href="http://mycheckpoint.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/html/sample/http/mcp_sql00/zoom/questions"><strong>demo</strong></a> here.</li>
</ol>
<h4>RPM distribution</h4>
<p>No excuse for this being so late, I know. But RPM distribution is now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mycheckpoint/">available</a>. Yeepee!</p>
<p>This is a <em>noarch</em> distribution, courtesy of Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/distutils/">distutils</a>; you should be able to install the package on any RPM supporting platform. I have only tested in on CentOS; feedback is welcome.</p>
<h4>Future plans</h4>
<p>Work is going on. These are the non-scheduled future tasks I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring InnoDB Plugin &amp; XtraDB status.</li>
<li>A proper <em>man</em> page.</li>
<li>Anything else that interests me &amp; the users.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Try it out</h4>
<p>Try out <em>mycheckpoint</em>. It’s a different kind of monitoring    solution. Simple monitoring (charting) is immediate. For more  interesting results you will need basic SQL skills, and in return you’ll  get a lot   of power under your hands.</p>
