<p>Following up on popular <em>"awesome-*"</em> lists (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python">awesome-python</a>, <a href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go">awesome-golang</a> etc.), I've created the <strong><a href="https://github.com/shlomi-noach/awesome-mysql">awesome-mysql</a></strong> curated list.</p>
<p>This is a list of technologies (and resources) in and around MySQL, and means to serve as a place to find reliable software and info. I recently happened to notice there are some tools I'm familiar with that are unknown to others; tools unknown to me that are in good use.</p>
<p>The list is naturally and intentionally incomplete. I wish this to be a community based creation; so I put some categories and some tools. I left many out, <em>deliberatey</em>. Please assist by filling in the missing projects, tools, libraries! Additions gladly accepted via pull-requests. Do note the <a href="https://github.com/shlomi-noach/awesome-mysql/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a> (somewhat lengthy, I apologize).</p>
<p>I will moderate FUDs, promotional, commercials etc., and otherwise it may take some days for me to merge requests.</p>
