<p>I get to hear that a lot: that LOCK TABLES with MyISAM is some sort of replacement for transactions; some model we can work with which gives us 'transactional flavor'.</p>
<p>It isn't, and here's why.</p>
<p>When we speak of a transactional database/engine, we check out its ACID compliance. Let's break out the ACID and see what LOCK TABLES provides us with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong>: Atomicity. MyISAM does not provide atomicity.  If we have LOCK TABLES followed by two statements, then closed by UNLOCK TABLES, then it follows that a crash between the two statements will have the first one applied, the second one not not applied. No mechanism ensures an "all or nothing" behavior.</li>
<li><strong>C</strong>: Consistency. An error in a statement would roll back the entire transaction in a transactional database. This won't work on MyISAM: every statement is "committed" immediately.</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>: Isolation. Without LCOK TABLES, working with MyISAM resembles using the <strong>read uncommitted</strong>, or <strong>dirty read</strong> isolation level. With LOCK TABLES - it depends. If you were to use LOCK TABLES ... WRITE on all tables in all statements, you would get the <strong>serializable</strong> isolation level. Actually it would be more than <strong>serializable</strong>. It would be <em>truely serial</em>.</li>
<li><strong>D</strong>: Durability. Did the INSERT succeed? And did the power went down just after? MyISAM provides not guarantees that the data will be there.</li>
</ul>
<p><!--more-->So of all ACID properties, the only thing we could get is a <strong>serializable</strong> isolation level, and that, too, only if we used LOCK TABLES ... WRITE  practically everywhere.</p>
<p>Where does the notion come from, then?</p>
<p>There's one thing which LOCK TABLES does help us with: race conditions. It effectively creates a mutex block. The same effect could be achieved when using GET_LOCK() and RELEASE_LOCK(). Perhaps this is the source of confusion.</p>
