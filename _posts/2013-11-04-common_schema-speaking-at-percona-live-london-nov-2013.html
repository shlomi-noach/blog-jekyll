<p>In one week's time I'll be presenting <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2013/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">common_schema: DBA's framework for MySQL</a> at Percona Live, London.</p>
<p>This talk introduces the rich toolset known as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a>. It is free, open source, extremely useful in solving DBA &amp; developer tasks, and is the next best thing ever invented next to SQL pie charts.</p>
<p>I'll introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Views, with which you can detect and terminate idle transactions, blocking transactions; roll your range partitions; find duplicate keys; block/unblock accounts; get fine grained privileges per account; find AUTO_ICNREMENT free space; ...</li>
<li>Routines: do meta executions such as eval(); get query checksums; duplicating accounts; killing suspicious connections; security auditing; parsing JSON data; ...</li>
<li>QueryScript: if you're not using it, you're missing on a powerful scripting language tightly integrated with SQL/MySQL. We'll see the basic constructs, variables, loops; the more sophisticated MySQL/locks/overhead/danger aware constructs such as foreach &amp; split; throttling, exceptions, it's all in there. I'll present real scripts that saved the day and challenge you to implement them in another scripting language.</li>
<li>Briefly introducing rdebug: stored routine debugger and debugging API</li>
<li>Roadmap (some cool things coming along)<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<h4>What this talk isn't</h4>
<p>A tedious "read the manual aloud". Nor is it a comprehensive listing of all functionality. These would be the surest way of sending you to sleep.</p>
<h4>What this talk is</h4>
<p>A view into the concepts behind <em>common_schema</em>; the reasons this project has justification to exist; the various problems it solves; and yes, interesting examples. Every single <em>common_schema</em> feature was developed out of real world need.</p>
<p>I am confident you'll find <em>common_schema</em> to have something you need that will improve your work as a developer or a DBA.</p>
<p>The talk is similar to <a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/speaking-at-percona-live-2013-common_schema-lightning-talks">the one I gave</a> at Santa Clara this April. It is updated with new content following recent developments.</p>
