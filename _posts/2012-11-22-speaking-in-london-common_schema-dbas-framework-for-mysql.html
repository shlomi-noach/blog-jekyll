<p>I'm happy to be speaking about <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a> at <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/london-2012/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">Percona Live London</a>, <strong>Dec 4th, 2012</strong>. This will be the first chance for me to speak about <em>common_schema</em>, what I believe to be an extremely useful companion to your MySQL server.</p>
<p>I will show you how <em>common_schema</em> can leverage your SQL skills and give you <em>new powers</em>. Stuff you had to be SQL-Perl-super-expert to work through is easily attainable with <em>common_schema</em> and QueryScript. Some maintenance, security and auditing tasks are now a breeze. Writing server side scripts can be fun!</p>
<p>What I <em>won't</em> do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the fancy manual aloud</li>
<li>Walk you through every possible view, column, function, parameter and script</li>
</ul>
<p>What I <em>will</em> do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the nature of <em>common_schema</em>, show you the concepts behind it (and it is built with concepts in mind)</li>
<li>Provide with selected examples (schema analysis, security, processes &amp; transactions) -- there's much to go by, but no boring drill down into all details.</li>
<li>Expose some cool hacks with <em>QueryScript</em></li>
<li>Do very brief (as time allows) live demos.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>common_schema</em> is an open source project and released under the BSD license.</p>
<p>Last April <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2012/sessions/common-schema-framework-mysql-server-administration">Roland Bouman gave a great talk</a> about <em>common_schema</em>. This will not be the same talk; a lot has been developed by this time.</p>
<p>I'll be speaking at a very challenging time slot; the three other talks running concurrent to my own are all great ones; I actually wanted to attend all three of them. Heck, <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/10/30/percona-live-london-2012-talks-you-do-not-want-to-miss/">Peter wants to</a> (though contrary to belief he can't <em>fork()</em> himself). So, no hard feelings if you choose another talk during this time slot. But I do know where you live.</p>
