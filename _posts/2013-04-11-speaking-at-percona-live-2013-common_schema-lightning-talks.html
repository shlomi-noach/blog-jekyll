<p>In two weeks time I will be giving these talks at Percona Live:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/commonschema-dbas-framework-mysql">common_schema: DBA's framework for MySQL</a>: an introduction to <a href="https://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a>, my evolving server side solutions project. This will be a revised version of the talk I gave at Percona Live London; I have felt some weaknesses during that talk, which I've thrown out, letting room for cool stuff. I will discuss <em>common_schema</em>'s various views, interesting and useful routines, the power of <strong><a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/query_script.html">QueryScript</a></strong>, and a brief intro to the newcomer <strong><a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/rdebug.html">rdebug</a></strong>, debugger and debugging API for MySQL. If you're not familiar with <em>common_schema</em>, it's a good time to pick up on what I (being most biased) consider to be your smart assistant to MySQL maintenance and administration!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/sessions/lt-query-which-peak-my-career">The query which is the peak of my career</a>: this is a 6 minute lightning talk. You're bound to attend if you're at the community reception (which you are), so I don't need to do promotional. You already payed the ticket and the doors will be locked. No escapees.</li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I'm concerned the conference can be closed down the moment I provide these two talks, and we can all go to the beach.</p>
<p>Wait, no, I will also be at the DotOrg Pavillion at the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/exhibit-hall">Exhibit Hall</a>, where I present <em>common_schema</em> and <a href="http://openarkkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openarkkit/doc/html/introduction.html">openark-kit</a>. Come by to hear more about these!</p>
