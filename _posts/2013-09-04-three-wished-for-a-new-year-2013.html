<div>
<p>Another new year by Jewish calendar. What do I wish for the following year?</p>
<ol>
<li>World peace</li>
<li>Good health to all</li>
<li>Get auto-vacuuming, disk space reclaiming InnoDB tablespaces</li>
</ol>
<p>No one likes rebuilding huge InnoDB tables. Rebuilds take time, effort, system resources and loss of sleep. I recently rebuilt a <strong>300GB</strong> table to realize it reduced to a mere <strong>45GB</strong>. How about some background automation?</p>
<p>My wishes in previous two years [<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wishes-for-a-new-year">2010</a>], [<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wishes-for-a-new-year-2">2011</a>], [<a href="http://code.openark.org/blog/mysql/three-wishes-for-a-new-year-201">2012</a>] have not come true. I'm still willing to settle for two out of three.</p>
