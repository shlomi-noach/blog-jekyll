<p>I'm pleased to announce the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/program/schedule/tutorials">availability of the Tutorials Schedule</a> for Percona Live MySQL Conference and Expo, 2013.</p>
<p>This schedule comes as the outcome of hard work put by the <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/conference-committee">reviewing committee</a> members. Thanks! This work is much appreciated!</p>
<p>We got a good number of submissions. We've also reached out to prominent speakers and companies we felt would give great tutorials. All were reviewed, rated, discussed, compared; re-reviewed; some required further feedback from speakers.</p>
<p>Thank you to all speakers for submitting their proposals! I'm very sorry if your tutorial didn't make it through -- we have good tutorials left out -- there's only so much time in one day!</p>
<h4>What can you expect to see in the tutorials?</h4>
<p>The single day tutorials should appeal to beginners, seasonal DBAs, developers and database experts alike. Talks target different levels, in <strong>6</strong> different tracks.</p>
<p>I think the king &amp; queen of the <strong>2013</strong> conference will be High Availability and the Cloud. This follows the trend of maturing HA solutions for MySQL and the emergence of MySQL cloud offerings or opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will have MySQL on Amazon, NDB Cluster, Tungsten Replicator, XtraDB &amp; Galera tutorials, as well as a HA evaluation tutorial. Pick your HA solution: chances are there's a good tutorial on the subject. If not - don't worry, lot's of HA sessions expected as well.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Not everything is HA. You will get the chance to learn about InnoDB architecture and tuning, Xtrabackup old and new features, and a full day operational DBA.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Down to basics, learn about how to Build your indexes, get to know your Sphinx search capabilities, or learn about TokuDB implementation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Or you could learn about Debugging and crash testing, or Advanced query optimizer tuning.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorials day is in particular important to settle as early as possible; it has a separate pricing model than the rest of the conference, and offers more in-depth drill downs into the particular technologies. So we're happy to make it through, and encourage you to <a href="http://www.percona.com/live/mysql-conference-2013/">register</a>. Thank you!</p>
