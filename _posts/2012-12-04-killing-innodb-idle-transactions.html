<p>The issue of terminating long-time idle open InnoDB transaction has been discussed recently by many. I wish to add my share, by proposing a quick and clean solution via <a href="http://code.google.com/p/common-schema/">common_schema</a>.</p>
<p><em>common_schema <strong>1.2</strong></em> provides with the <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/innodb_transactions.html"><strong>innodb_transactions</strong></a> view, which relies on <strong>INNODB_TRX</strong> - one of the InnoDB Plugin views in <strong>INFORMATION_SCHEMA</strong> - as well as on <strong>PROCESSLIST</strong>, and so is able to determine with certainty that a transaction has been idle for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>innodb_transactions</strong> offers us with a <strong>sql_kill_query</strong> column, which produces a <strong>'KILL QUERY 12345'</strong> type of value. So we can:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>SELECT <strong>sql_kill_query</strong> FROM <strong>innodb_transactions</strong> WHERE <strong>trx_idle_seconds &gt;= 10; 
</strong>+-------------------+
| sql_kill_query    |
+-------------------+
| KILL QUERY 292509 |
| KILL QUERY 292475 |
+-------------------+<strong> </strong></pre>
</blockquote>
<p><em>common_schema</em>'s useful <a href="http://common-schema.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common_schema/doc/html/eval.html"><strong>eval()</strong></a> routine allows us to actually invoke those <strong>KILL</strong> statements, all in a one-liner:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>call <strong>eval</strong>(<span style="color: #003366;">'SELECT <strong>sql_kill_query</strong> FROM innodb_transactions WHERE <strong>trx_idle_seconds &gt;= 10</strong>'</span>);</pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>Technical details<!--more--></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>trx_idle_seconds</strong> notes the time, in seconds, the transaction has been idle, or 0 if the transaction is not idle at all.</li>
<li><strong>sql_kill_query</strong> is a self-generated SQL query which kills the running query, e.g. <strong>'KILL QUERY 12345'</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>eval()</strong> takes a query as text, retrieves the SQL resulting column, and executes it live.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Background details</h4>
<p>The connection between <strong>INNODB_TRX</strong> and <strong>PROCESSLIST</strong> is not synchronous. It is possible that by the time one is querying <strong>INNODB_TRX</strong>, <strong>PROCESSLIST</strong> data may change (e.g. next query is already replacing the one you were considering in <strong>INNODB_TRX</strong>). But in our case it is of little consequence: we are interested in transactions that have been idle for quite some time. Say, <strong>10</strong> seconds. So we are not troubled by having <strong>200</strong> queries per second changing under our hands.</p>
<p>If the transaction has been asleep for <strong>10</strong> seconds, and we decide to kill it, well, it is possible that just as we kill it it will turn active again. It's a risk we take no matter what kind of solution we apply, since there's no atomic "get-status-and-kill" operation on InnoDB transactions.</p>
<p>The above solution is manual: one must invoke the query which kills the idle transactions. This is as opposed to a built-in server feature which does the same. Events can used to semi-automate this: one can call upon this query once every <strong>10</strong> seconds, for example.</p>
