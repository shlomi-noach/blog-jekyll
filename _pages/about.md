This blog follows my software engineering work, most of it around MySQL.

I'm Shlomi Noach, and am enthusiast about writing software and solving problems. I've worked (and still am working) with big, busy and highly available systems and services. I in particular enjoy sharing my solutions with the world via blogging and via open source.

I author a bunch of open source projects:

- [orchestrator](https://github.com/outbrain/orchestrator)
- [gh-ost](https://github.com/github/gh-ost)
- [common_schema](https://github.com/shlomi-noach/common_schema)
- [ccql](https://github.com/github/ccql)
- and some more.

I curate a list of MySQL quality open source software: [awesome-mysql](https://github.com/shlomi-noach/awesome-mysql)

I'm recipient of Oracle ACE, Oracle Technologist of the Year, and MySQL Community Member of the Year awards.
